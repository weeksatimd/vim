# markdown-preview.vim

Markdown Preview allows you to compile and preview markdown as generated HTML files. It has the ability to select and use customized stylesheets for  previewing your own awesomeness. Previewing occurs within the default browser.

For more information on the plugin: `:help markdown-preview` within Vim or take a look at the [help files](http://github.com/mkitt/markdown-preview.vim/blob/master/doc/markdown-preview.txt) on github.


## Install

Download, fork, clone, or use it as a submodule within your .vim directory.


## Dependencies

Markdown Preview requires the following:

- Vim version 7.0 or above with Ruby support
- Discount for converting markdown to html and it's available in your path

The easiest way to get Discount is `brew install discount` if your rocking homebrew. If not, see the installation instructions from [David Parson's Discount repository](https://github.com/Orc/discount)

While not a requirement, default directories are tailored to work within a bundle directory as specified by the pathogen plugin.

Has only been tested to work with MacVim and Vim from Terminal at this point.


## Todo

- Multiple User Style Directories
